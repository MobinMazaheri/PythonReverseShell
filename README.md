# Python3-ReverseShell
Hacker Sploit Ethical Hacker bootcamp Python Reverse Shell I updated to work with Python3 with some tweaks

Start by changing the port and IP values in server.py and reverse.py to the attack machine IP and the port you want to listen on. 

Execute server.py on the attack machine followed by reverse.py on the target machine. Once it establishes a connection, you will end up with a shell environment to the target machine. 

Updates may need to be made further to have specfic commands run on the target machine. 

You may need to  stop firewalld or other services potentially stopping the connection.
