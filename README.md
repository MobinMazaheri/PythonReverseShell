# Python3-ReverseShell
Hacker Sploit Ethical Hacker bootcamp Python Reverse Shell I updated to work with Python3

Start by changing the port and IP values in the scripts on line 40 of server.py and 39 of reverse.py.

Execute server.py on the attack machine followed by reverse.py on the target machine. Once it establishes a connection, you will end up with a shell environment to the target machine. 

Updates will need to be made further to have specfic commands run on the target machine. 

You may need to  stop firewalld or other services potentially stopping the connection.
